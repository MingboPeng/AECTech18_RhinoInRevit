# Rhino Inside Revit
The Rhino Inside technology allows Rhino and Grasshopper to be embedded within other products.

This folder contains a sample project that demonstrates:

1. Starting Rhino and Grasshopper as a Revit Addon.
2. Call directly into the native Revit APIs from a Grasshopper or Rhino plugin.
2. Grasshopper definitions can be opened and previewed in Rhino within the Revit process.
3. Object can be natively created by Rhino or Grasshopper within Revit through the API.

## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
* Git client. ([download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
* Visual Studio 2017 ([download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/))
* Rhino WIP ([download](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/wip))
* Autodesk Revit 2017-2019 ([download](https://www.autodesk.com/products/revit/free-trial))

### Getting Source & Build
1. Clone the repository. At the command prompt, enter the following command:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mcneel/rhino.inside.git rhino.inside
```
2. In Visual Studio: open _rhino.inside\Autodesk\Revit\RhinoInside.Revit.sln_.
3. Set the Solution Configuration drop-down according the Revit version you have installed. This will properly link the correct Revit API libraries to the project.
4. Navigate to _Build_ > _Build Solution_ to begin your build.

### Installing & Uninstalling
The project is configured to copy .addon file as well as output files to the folder _"%APPDATA%\\Autodesk\\Revit\\Addins\\%RevitVer%\\RhinoInside.Revit\\"_ folder in order to make Revit load this addon next time it runs.

In order to uninstall it you can use Visual Studio _Build_ > _Clean Solution_ command or just navigate to the folder _"%APPDATA%\\Autodesk\\Revit\\Addins\\%RevitVer%\\_ and remove the file _RhinoInside.Revit.addon_ and the folder _RhinoInside.Revit_.

## Using the samples
* Once you launch Revit it will warn you this addon is not verified, please click on "Load allways" or "Load once".
* Create a new project or open an existing one.
